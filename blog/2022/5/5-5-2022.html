<h1>The 5/5 Post</h1>
<h2>May 5 2022 14:15 PST</h2>
    
<p>Hi reader, I just finished transcribing onto html <a href="/blog/writing/3-29-2022.html">something that I wrote</a> at the end of March. I remember it being a hot day and thinking to myself that I couldn't possibly write anything while it's hot and I'm sweaty and dirty from a long day. It took a few minutes, but I remember very specifically thinking "What could I possibly write about?", interrupting that thought with a gasp, and bending down to write what has to be the first completed piece of creating writing I had done in two, three, maybe four years. When I was transcribing it, as opposed to the other two things currently in the "BAD!!!!!!!!! writing" category (<a href="/blog/writing/4-13-2022.html">zone.txt</a>, <a href="/blog/writing/4-18-2022.html">lake.txt</a>), I decided to not edit any of the piece. Do you get that feeling when transcribing stuff? (this bozo just asked a question to an audience which CANNOT REPLY). When I wrote it down, it felt <i>very</i> different to typing something; different ideas were coming to me, and different ways to write what I wanted to write were, too. But it's pen to paper, right, so you get one shot, so while writing, I chose only what felt the most honest and logical to me. It's hard to explain what that even means! But it felt good to write something that made sense to the most of me from start to finish whilst also being honest. It's the kind of honesty you don't get often, right? Because who are you gonna be honest to in your own little esoteric way but <i>yourself.</i> I'm glad to be writing stuff, even if it's weird and kind of lame; I forgot I can express myself in writing, and that writing can be done outside of academic essays. The person who reminded me otherwise is mentioned in the footnote of that late March post I mentioned at the start of this paragraph! To them: The biggest thank you possible, even if you're not reading this, you are awesome.</p>

<p>It's really great to be able to express myself again, but isn't that so weird? Writing is so primitive of a concept that it's something around the first or second technology you can research in every Civilization game (Except for Beyond Earth, I assume). It's been with us since BABYLON. Probably before, too, somewhere in East Asia. I know that a lot of technologies attributed to Europe had some form that predates them that was created in Asia. At least that's the case with gunpowder, so that's where I base the assumption off of (PSYCHO blog author ADMITS to spreading MISINFORMATION). Which reminds me of one time, I was talking with some friends, and we were (I was) talking about the Dark Ages, and I said something like</p>

<p>"Yeah, that caused us to get set back in technology for NO reason."</p>

<p>And I <i>realized,</i> actually, that I had said "us" as if I was European, too. But in retrospect, it's interesting to think; I live in the United States, and it has almost as much of a legacy of colonization as does Europe, and I myself am most probably trackable to a Conquistador who killed a bunch of people in South and Centroamerica. I know it was just normal language reasons as to why I said "us" during that, but I also think it makes sense that as somebody who's a biproduct of colonialism living in a GIANT biproduct of colonialism, I would accidentally associate myself <i>with</i> the continent responsible for the whole thing. It's weird, and it's also weird that this is probably something a lot of the people I know online don't think about a lot. It makes sense why they wouldn't, but it's still a bit weird. I just checked the time, and it's 2:45PM; it feels like we're approaching on 6PM. Window's open, it's cold, breeze is coming in, clouds in the sky, and I'm listening to the Minecraft OST on my phone. It's really pretty! And it also makes for very nice writing music.</p>

<p>Reading back, it's also a bit weird how being a pansexual dude with fucked up gender expression desires that i go through with at different quantities at different times, being somewhere within the LGBT+ category means that meeting new communities online is a lot harder than it would be otherwise. This isn't me wringing sympathy points from you; it's just <i>weird.</i> I'll join online communities and immediately search for mentions of "trans" to see if transphobia is welcomed there or not. Sometimes I meet people through one of my friends, and I'm really nervous around them because I don't know if they hate me because of who I am. I mean, it's not hard to assume that if you're cis and straight, these are not issues you deal with; you join communities, you meet new people, and never do you worry about something like "Do these people hate me?" It's weird when I think about how much of the stuff that I think about most people don't and don't <i>have</i> to think about. I mean, I get on fine, but it's just a bit of a weird weight to have on me.</p>

<p>Returning to that second paragraph before the big tangent, I want to say that I have a bunch of ideas for both this blog and my writing in general. I still have to finish rebranding this site; as of writing this, the background color and gradient haven't been changed, neither has the "back" button. Rust's (thank u ruuust) .html pages are all still on the site directory, and I don't have a general intro page. As for writing, though, I just need to push up the motivation. Sitting down and writing something like this, though, is a good sign that I can do it. Even if this is a lot easier than putting a whole story together, it's still better than sitting down to play 1230984765 hours of 4X strategy games. And that's good! And SPEAKING of 4X strategy games, GOD! I FEEL LIKE SUCH A NERD WRITING ALL OF THIS! I KNOW I'M HOT SHIT BUT THE WAY I WRITE ALL OF THIS IS SO DIFFERENT TO THE WAY I TALK WITH PEOPLE AND TYPE MESSAGES AND I LOOK WAY NERDIER THAN I ACTUALLY AM TRUST ME! With friends I'm all like JIOGRGRTJTHB5NO5ETPOBT with, but that's because I <i>love</i> hanging out with the homies, so it's how it goes. But this blog is different! It's, like, a little zen spot where I can sit, be calm, collect the events that I've been thinking about or have been <i>wanting</i> to think about, talk, and let it all out in a slow, unraveling post on a blog with a concurrent monthly .5 people reading. The reason I brought this up is because I beg you PLEASE don't look at me like I'm some nerd hunched over his basement PC after not having seen another person in eight years. THESE POSTS MIGHT READ NERDY AS HELL BUT THEY'RE MY ZEN ZONE SO SHH I CAN BE AS NERDY AS I WANNA BE HERE SHHH D:< </p>

<p>Thank you for reading this. It's 3:25PM PST now (this is editor chris it's now 3:33PM PST I'm hitting "commit" now bye), and I've been thinking about this cool doughnut place I went to recently. I've been thinking of goin' back............ I'll see what I do. Bye-bye! <3</p>
