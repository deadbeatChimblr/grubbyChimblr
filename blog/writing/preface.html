<h1>THE ULTRA IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY-TO-READ PREFACE</h1>
<h2>May 4 21:23 PST</h2>

<p>Hi! A lot of my writing is me talking to myself because I can't write other ppl GRRRRRRRR AND because I want to and sort of <i>have</i> to talk with myself about the dumb esoteric bs that I can't really talk about w/ anyone but a therapist. Because of the nature of the stuff I'm gonna be putting in this category, I'm putting this forewarning here to say that my mental health is fine and under care and this is only a creative outlet for my brain gunk thank you ok you can go now mwa mwa lots of love chris :o)</p>
