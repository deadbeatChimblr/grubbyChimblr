<p>MSSB World Tour (or MWT/MSSBWT, or Microsoft Sam Speaker Box World Tour), is an animated series that I built off of camp entries for the camp The Best of The Best (TBOTB). For the ones uninitiated, imagine a <b>camp</b> as an object show, except people play as the characters they compete as. In this case, the characters were Microsoft Sam Speaker Box and TV. Both used TTS voices. I constantly got first (or at best the top half) in the challenges, and the camp collapsed in of itself a handful of times. I was starting to realize that these camp entries were getting pretty hefty, so I wanted to work on them on my own time outside of the camp. (CFAN4 also does this, but that's a newer idea...)</p>

	<td><p>The "leader" of the group, MSSB drags the rest along on his ventures, dealing with Viola, deciding whether or not to destroy her again. MSSB's design is based off of the BFDI's Announcer, although with a red color scheme to match that of the portrayal of Microsoft Sam in unrelated series regarding the character reading "Funny Windows Errors".</p></td></tr>

	<td><p>Showing up from the start, TV is the companion that tags along, providing information (and unwanted opinions) when necessary. The stain is from punching in cold blood, for your information.</p></td></tr>

	<td><p>Originally the host for the camp, Viola is pummeled by the rest of the group after giving the two some stupid challenges. Who sends someone to Minecraft to get diamonds and a shelter? Go get the materials yourself, dumbass!<br>She's also not supposed to have arms...I think. Here she is with arms anyways.</p></td></tr>
