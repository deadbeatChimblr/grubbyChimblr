    <p>Yet another thing:</p>

    <p>It's come to you that you're not different. That you're not special, that of all the uniqueness in this world, none of it is for you. You're listless in nature; no effort by your own agency can give you what you most want and most desperately lack: The ability to stand out above everybody else and know you're a different cut. Every part of your mind brings a different knife to your own personal Ides of March, and you fall apart into uncountable pieces. It's poisonous to think the suffering of others, their formative experiences and their ascension from their painful enviornments is something you want. But you stand alone without a culture, you're long ensconced by an oppressive protection, and the deep nobody inside of you always crudely reaches out to any strand he can find; anything to hold onto so he knows he has an identity. It's the allegory of the cave; it only took weeks to break down the decades-long security you had in yourself. You realized you're a mummy, obedient to your desire for blank entertainment. When you experienced firsthand the full capacity of human's mind, you shattered at having not used even a passing thought of it. Now what? Now what do you do with the burning jealousy of a two-decades late-start to being alive? Around you sit the most fulfilled, the ones who bring you the heaviest envy possible. When you've been robbed humanity your whole life, it's more than obvious you should rage and throw yourself. This envy is your birthright. It's why overcoming it feels like cheap mockery of those around you.</p>
    
    <p>Obviously, though, you have to start. You're a blank slate in the most human form. Think for yourself and see the things you've hidden from all your life. It's not your suicide if your nothing is your start instead of your end. Let curiousity guide you over envy; let unguided passion take control from listless mindKill. The things you envy you don't need; the desire to have your own formative moment is your desire to be someone, so listen, learn, watch, experience, and from everything you've put in your mind, do, so you can be somebody you're satisfied with. Don't surrender to your emptiness; go from it.</p>
