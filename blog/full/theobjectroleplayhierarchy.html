<h1>part 1 (11/13/2019)</h1>
<h2>9:04 am</h2>
hi it's me rust i'm very stressed because i've been trying to get prepared for my science test but it's actually TODAY and the study notes are NOTHING BUT QUESTIONS without telling me what the actual information is i am very STRESSED about it. why do tests have to be like this? the study guides don't help out that much and all i have are my previous unit 1 notes that only cover ONE CHAPTER. the test is supposed to cover the entire unit and it's about weather. speaking of weather, it's also very foggy outside, yet it's bright enough that it's not too dark where i am. otherwise besides all of that i'm actually doing pretty fine for myself. i'm just tired is all.
<br>
<br>
today im going to continue with some objectbloxia stuff that happened last night. if you remember from last post, master joined a server when i just finished working on the new club, and master just tried to be as uncomfortable as possible, so pem and i did our best to handle with the situation so the others could actually work on stuff. however, master persisted, and was just <b>determined</b> to piss us off some way or another. master even kept calling me a furry, which he hates if you remember that detail. if i had to be honest, the guy probably has nothing better to do than just spam his garbage on the game.
<br>
<br>
some admin stuff later, i started to get tired of most of this. for one, master never joins object whatever if im correct, object whatever is say the other object roleplay game on roblox that im aware of. it actually has <i>more</i> popularity than objectbloxia with more daily players during prime time, and there's way more areas, improved scripts, and other features that are interesting. i currently have plans to join the <b>dev team</b> of that game after building an example model that cherry (the game's creator) is actually going to use, the model being for gelatin's steakhouse, more based off of the BFDIA counterpart rather than the BFB counterpart, where it's more wide and shorter. cherry actually really liked the model and said that i'd be able to join the dev team, which have their own custom morphs too.
<br>
<br>
the one downside with object whatever might be it's "3rd party rule". the 3rd party rule is when you play as a character that isn't an object, and that's about it. something like "red plumber hat" to hint to mario would be the closest we can get to, however. luckily, i have made original characters in the past, so i can get my own decals included eventually in the super cool secret dev menu. i'd continue the discussion with this but y'know it's
<h2>9:49 am</h2>
so yeah. self explanatory. k see you bYE AGAIN
<h1>part 2 (11/14/2019)</h1>
<h2>9:01 am</h2>
hi it's me rust and this is just tradition again isn't it? yeah i forgot to type about yesterday and now we have this 2 parter once again, probably longer. so today i'll continue off of where we left off. alright so yeah object whatever and the "super cool secret dev menu" thing. in this case, the dev menu is for morphs made by the developers that only <i>they</i> can use. no one else can use it due to how it's scripted into the game. if i were to get the developer role (in which that's what im hoping to get) this would allow me to use all the funny btools/F3X (the tools used to build on the servers) alongside being able to use developer morphs, such as the ones i was hoping to add in. downside here is that the creator, cherry, doesn't have the service that the <i>rest</i> of us use in order to communicate on something off of roblox's turf, that being discord. yep, the one that ALL the parents hate!!! like DUDE imagine if a discord user that was reported on the news for no reason said "trans rights", then parents all around the WORLD would start hating TRANS PEOPLE 'cause that <b>ONE GUY</b> said it
<br>
<br>
back on track yeah the point of this <i>whole</i> thing was to show cherry my worth so <i>he</i> could add <b><i>me</i></b> to the object whatever dev team so i could get away from objectbloxia for a bit. for the people who don't know, one guy keeps showing up on objectbloxia and has always been a pain in the ass ever since he first joined due to some of the worst behavior i've seen from a person with the worst arguments and sole purpose is to piss everyone off. surprisingly, it wasn't from 4chan, although i haven't checked up on tha. <i>no</i> it's just master. what, you think it'd be someone <b>important</b>? HAAAAAAAAAAAAH, you must be J O K I N G my dude! this dude's a wreck and i treat him like one too. lately i've come up with the most BRILLIANT idea to deal with these.......CLOWNS!!!!!!!!!! as of late. with the invention of admin scripts, we can do rAtHeR wAcKy ThInGs called jailing people. the command <code>:jail (player)</code>, of course! this command allows me to trap people in a rectangular transparent box so that it looks like they're in a rather cool futuristic jail cell. the players in it won't be ale to get out of the jail, and if they try to reset they'll just be brought back into the jail,they're only way of getting out of it being to either rejoin the game or wait until someone used <code>:unjail (player)</code> to remove them from the jail.
<br>
<br>
so what does jailing people have to do with my idea? does it involve <i>creating a communist environment</i>? while we already have roblox china during an unfinished season, that is <b>not the case my DUDE!!!!!!</b> this is actually something ive been doing for a bit but haven't really done it in a better mood until of recently, introducing the not so brand new <b><i>LAMP TECHNIQUE!</i></b> the lamp technique is where you use <code>:jail (player)</code> and <code>:light (player) ffffff</code> to make them act like a lamp, stationary and emitting light. on occasions i also like to turn on <code>:nograv (player)</code> and <code>:loopfling (player)</code> so that they fling  around like they're in space endlessly. the nograv command makes their gravity close to zero and loopfling is just fling but in an endless loop until using <code>:unloopfling (player)</code> to make them stop flopping like a fish all the time, although there's also the command <code>:seizure (player)</code> that literally does just THAT, make them flop like a fish like if they were listening to epic RAVE MUSIC. speaking of which, here's today's featured song that probably fits into this category. very good Tune's!!!

<br>
<br>
okay that's enough EPIC DANCING. BACK ON TRACK! this whole lamp technique was actually made for me to handle master in such a way that might actually benefit <i>both</i> sides of the argument. what the HELL do i mean by that? well the lamp thing allows master to still be part of the game (although i keep a close eye on him) but handicapped in a way that makes him less of a threat towards the rest of the community unless he starts spamming, then of which i just do the mute and/or kick, or ban if any admins are around. really, the whole thing is based on <i>conditions</i> and what to expect out of it.
<h2>9:45 am</h2>
oh golly, look at the time. it's time for me to go. well, i'll talk about more of the time when i use the lamp technique and even show off screenshots this time around when i get back! i have another cdli class after recess and at the last subject for the afternoon, so i have 3 sessions to go trough meaning i still have some time before im actually able to get the screenshots (the only way i can technically get them as soon as possible is that i would send the image on this website's discord server and copy/save the image from my current end). anyways, that's about all, see you in several hours! i might as well just <b>not show up at <i>all</i></b> if that's what you're expecting! have a good one (for now)!
<br>
<br>
<h2>11:18 am</h2>
welcome back, it's now officially social studies time! do you know what that means?? no?? too bad!! it's time for the semi-daily...
<center><p class="boxed"><marquee behavior="alternate"; scrollamount="15">lets all laugh at a church that never learns anything <b>TEE HEE HEE</b>.</marquee></p></center>
we last left off with galileo, whose theories about specific information in regards to science was published in a book, leading the church to out galileo on trial before he was possibly tortured. the church, y'know, did the ol' "we're going to kill you to death if you don't stop saying this <b>cringe</b> that we don't believe in my amigo bro ham". galileo lied his way out of it so that he wouldn't be tortured. however, the church was still a jerk enough to the point where all they did was just. y'know. <i>put him forever in house arrest</i>. what's WORSE is that the church only thought "HMM THIS IS ACTUALLY A REALLY BAD SITUATION THAT WE FORGOT ABOUT" and realized that galileo was right OVER 200 YEARS LATER. <b><i>200 YEARS LATER LIKE HOLY CRAP</i></b> does the church even know what COOL means????????? it's anything good but THIS. in this case, the church's fear was that <code>if people were to believe that their astronomy teachings were wrong, the people may start thinking about other stuff as well</code>.
<p class="footnote">footnote: this here was the quote from galileo during his trial so that he wouldn't get tortured by the church. i wonder if god had this in mind when he invented people
    <br>
    <br>
    "With sincere heart and unpretended faith I abjure, curse, and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies [of Copernicus] and also every other error...contrary to the Holy Church, and I swear that in the future I will never say again or assert ... anything that might cause a similar suspicion towards me."
    <br>
    - Galileo, <i>The Discoverers</i>
</p>
<br>
<br>
enough of galileo, it's time for FRANCIS BACON!!!!
<br>
<br>
<img src="/img/blog/2019/11/bacon.jpg" width="1250px">
<br>
<br>
NO!!!!!! not <i>THAT</i> bacon!!!!!! this is a rather large BRUH MOMENT, my man. anyways, the actual bacon we're mentioning here is none other than <b>Francis Bacon</b>, the man who argued that lives could be improved by understanding the world better. this lead to him developing none other than the.... ScIeNtIfIc MeThOd!!! THAT'S RIGHT, that was <b>HIS</b> invention ! not YOURS..... neither was the LIGHTBULB that wasn't your invention either.
<br>
<br>
if you don't know, the scientific method is actually <code>question > hypothesis > experimental procedure > observation > analysis</code>. you might have seen these details in science projects before when you were told to fill out specific stuff such as "a prediction of what you think's gonna happen", also known as the HYPOTHESIS MY DUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>
next person on our list of rather famous people is actually <b>Rene Descartes</b> !  he was a french philosopher and mathematician from 1596 to 1650. his very popular quote is "I think; therefore I am". the <i>very</i> classical quote. unlike our bacon friend, rene likes to use <b>Logic</b> and <b>Reasoning</b>. he used logic to the point where he could only believe originally that <i>he</i> existed. how could you PROVE that god exists in that case? what does he even DO? does he just play CHECKERS WITH THE CLOUDS.......... i would only assume so, just for the thought that maybe, just MAYBE that he owns a wii and that he actually plays Wii Bowling during thunderstorms... heh, mii jesus. hehe.
<br>
<br>
WHO'S THAT CHEMIST?????????????????? ROBERT BOYLE!!!!!!!! <b>Robert Boyle</b> was an english chemist that lived from 1627 to 1691. during the medieval times when cutting off heads was perfectly okay, some people in the world practiced a practice known as alchemy. some people believed that "any substance could become another". however, robert was officially having NONE of that. robert did the thing and performed experiments which eventually lead to <i>him</i> creating a law called Boyle's Law.
<p class="footnote">footnote: boyle's law states that if the volume of a gas is decreased, the pressure increases proportionally.</p>
as part of the law, this introduced particles to the scientific mixture of information. robert used this RATHER COMEDIC INFORMATION to define the difference between <b>elements</b> and <b>compounds</b>, thus finally proving  that alchemy was KINDA STUPID AND NOT REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO BEGIN WITH.
<br>
<br>
now i'm sure you've ALL known about the invention of the laws of gravity, right?? let me introduce you (or reintroduce you) to the man called <b>isaac newton</b>. the old saying goes, an apple fell on his head and later believed that motion could be explained with the <b>rather comedic</b> thing called MATHEMATICS, leading people to think that anything can be solved with math. the dude was so cool that he even gave us this RATHER INTERESTING (BUT NOT COMEDIC) quote that i actually <code>do not have</code> because when i was gonna type it down the slide changed. no more Newton for u sorry but that's just how mafia works.
<br>
<br>
<code>*checks the list of people*</code> ah YES... andreas vesalius, the belgian physician from 1514 to 1564. in the year 1543, vesalius published a book called <i>on structure of the human body</i>. in this case, andreas had to actually take a dead body and open it up when he still could so that he could observe how it looks. this was considered very controversial in the church due to being against their actions. prior to all of this RATHER  COOL  KNOWLEDGE was the ancient theory that the body wasn't made up of ANYTHING besides Four Humors. we got BLACK BILE, YELLOW BILE, blood, and... PHLEGM?? what the fuck is phlegm it sounds like someone just slammed their hands on the keyboard and phlegm was one of the things that came out of it. due to this, a common way to fix the fever was to <b>cut someone so they lose enough blood so that they don't have "too much"</b>. shit's crazy mang o_O. thankfully, due to this disturbing stuff, we learnt that it was KINDA STUPID much like ALCHEMY, and that anatomy is a probably important thing. this lead to it being a legit field in medical stuff. props to HIM my FUNKY DUDE!
<br>
<br>
in conclusion, the 15th and 16th century scientists did cause a large impact on the world. without them, we wouldn't have rather interesting stuff like medicine and laws of gravity and gas! <i>people were no longer the center of the universe</i>. this slideshow also came with a cool comic that sorta explains it, but it seems more like a <code>boomer comic</code>, so please forgive me, but i didn't make the sideshow so <i>there's that i Guess??????? o_O</i> anyways eat this it's probably the flavour of olives.

<h2>11:59 am</h2>
the morning's almost over, wow! that's a lot of words. i guess that ends our "lets all laugh at a church that never learns anything <b>TEE HEE HEE</b>" session of the day. hmm, what was i talking about earlier this morning? O YEAH!!!!!!!! the ACTUAL POINT OF THIS BLOG POST. bro im sorry for being <i>RATHER INCREDIBLY BORING</i> but i assure you that i have better stuff planned for when i get back. it involves OBJECTBLOXIA like it's supposed to, and you get to see some TOUHOU too!!!!!!! i hope you like <code>cucumbers</code> since that's one of their traits. anyways yeah IM OFF AGAIN K BYE <code>*explodes violently*</code>
<h2>2:07 pm</h2>
and now we're back in the science class! i just got back from <i>ENGLISH CLASS</i> where we started to do the questions for one of the chapters, and man iif you didn't like quotes before you'll just HATE them now. the book is called "the lord of the flies" and is in no way related to the lord of the rings, so that's already one problem with it, a really bad misleading title. the book's actually about some kids who survive a <i>not very good plane crash</i> with the airport fucking EXPLODING over some sorta. <b>ATOM BOMB</b> because that's TOTALLY FINE, and now all the children of the island, as young as SIX YEARS OLD, now have to live their lives on a remote island until the main character's father come pick them up on a boat if he hasn't already exploded by the <b>ATOM BOMB</b>. like seriously why was there ven an atom bomb in the first place, what kind of airport has a fucking atom bomb in the middle of it, is it some sorta national monument tht someone accidentally blew up or something. i don't understand anything about it.
<br>
<br>
anyways, enough on the one book that i generally dislike, lets talk about what i was going to talk about, the whole roleplay that was going on over on objectbloxia! back in a day, or as in like a few weeks ago, i used to have this large collection of touhou decals with this weird square style that i thought was interesting. since i never made more proper touhou art to convert into decals (yet), i decided to use one of the <b>square style</b> images again. this time, i decided to be nitori. she gives me mio vibes for some reason.
<p class="footnote">footnote: this whole "mio vibes" thing is because of how they both have the similar hair style. that's about it.</p> 
nitori's the character with a green hat, and a large backpack. one of her fandom traits (or one of her actual traits im not sure) is that she likes cucumbers. i can't really <i>relate</i> to that considering i haven't actually tried one before, but hey it seems good enough so i might try it when i can. she is actually a pretty fun character to roleplay as! her nature of trying to build machines and interest in specific matters makes her a comedic character to play as too! i'd love to try and be more serious with the characters soon but once i have all the gtx decals for the ones im trying to use done, then i'll be good to go. now, obviously enough, <i>master</i> was there as usual, so when he wasn't busy being banned by the admins, i just turned him into a lamp and kept an eye on the shit that he was spewing out of his disgusting mouth. not going to lie, master works great as a lamp when he's actually fucking <b>behaving</b> like everyone else (arguably) is. i swear, sometimes i can't even deal with the guy so i get someone else to do it, then <b><i>THEY</i></b> give up. master's just too determined man, can't take it. we gotta do something about this someday.
<h2>2:57 pm</h2>
on with the roleplay! <code>*checks the time*</code> ...well, uh, in a bit! i have to go home now after a student council meeting and all that. i'll go off topic on that for another hour later.

<h1>part 3 (11/15/2019)</h1>
<h2>11:05 am</h2>
hi it's me rust and im totally not trying to act like scott the woz with my intro .  no one has actually <i>told</i> me that but i just suspect SOMEONE's gonna do that RATHER COMEDIC THING and call me OuT oN iT and then i get <b>cancelled</b> on Twitter and then my Windows gets in d a n g e r e    which is NOT VERY GOOD. anyways yeah im currently in career class and one of my friends is trying to make another "weird story" for the 40324823rd time, with the only difference making it interesting is that some other person from the class is using the voice chat to sound russian and actually READ THE STORY........ yeah imagine havin like a <b>really COOL russian accent</b> and using it to say the weirdest fuckin stories in the history of MANKIND.
<p class="boxed"><b>
    one time, there was an extremely saturated cheerio [running] down the rain gutter when the loch ness monster ate it and crunched his earlobes but as it turns out, it [wasn't] the loch ness monster... it was the garbage man named d'sarwinny</b>
    <br>
    - the guy who makes these weird ass stories that someone with a russian voice can read
</p>
yeah stuff like this is crazy. our teacher actually have to give him a new sort of "weird story quota" because it escalated to the point where it just distracts the <i>entire damn class</i>. it was worth it thought.no we get to hear them in russian if it wasn't out of this world enough!!! anyways yeah, i can never keep a promise on blog posts can i...... least i've been able to push them out daily for a good bit, can't wait to JINX THAT!!!. anyways today we're gonna continue off and start talking about the roleplay that i was going to mention from <a href="19-11-14.html">part 2</a> so check that out if you haven't already. alright, let's get down to business with that.
<br>
<br>
the roleplay begins with me getting the morph for square style nitori, which if you don't remember, is the character from touhou that likes cucumbers and builds epic machines. was probably the girl that invented the double decker toaster .  <b>very Smart move!</b> i don't have many screenshots but for the one that i do have i'l save for when we get to it. anyways! we begin with nitori actually going to the objectbloxia mainland and going <i>"well B L I M E y   look at This!!!!!!!! it's STUFF!"</i> and proceeds to check out pretty much everything. we got the metal box, giant oven, hand powered recovery center, y'know, because i'm pretty sure everyone's fine with a <b>big ass oven</b> just casually hanging about the place. anyways, nitori did not give a FUCK about any of that because she found what she used as a base to make her next flying machine of really coolness.
<br>
<br>
y'know, a flying tree. the usual thing. somewhat uncommon type of tree in objectbloxia but it does the job for.. being a tree, i guess. a half job, since half of it doesn't even exist.
<br>
<br>
nitori took the tree and decided to make a rather interesting flying machine with it after saying "well blimey if it isn't a FLYING TREE!! what a nice scientific revolution, i could MAKE SOMETHING WITH THIS.......". so she made the funny and had some trouble to get it flying. in the end it all worked out. ladies and <b>F R I C K S</b>... may i introduce you to the NITORI MOBILE!!!!!!!!!

<br>
a true wonderful invention if i had to be honest, one of the best! forget everything else <b>including</b> club ice and club rust, get ready for the NITORI MOBILE, work at it's fucking FINEST. the rest of the roleplay was just me flying around in the mobile till i got bored and got off of it. ...<b>BUT IM Not done yET!!!</b>. THAT'S right you thought it was OVER?? not yET!!! because this is where it gets interesting. master decides to join in midway while im doing the funny airplane thing so i LAMP him with <code>:light</code> and <code>:jail</code> and he then becomes the lamp. master was always the person that i just fucking downright <b>HATED</b> due to the stuff that he says towards others and how he wants to kill the entire furry population like that's NORMAL by any means. let me just tell you now that it is NOT NORMAL at all to try and do such thing. you're already dealing with a large enough crowd of people and you want to commit GENOCIDE on them. like this isn't <i>madness combat</i> my dude it ain't entertaining unlike MADNESS COMBAT like HOO BOY. anyways yeah, when master is put in lamp jail, he's... somewhat more tolerable unless he says a bad. happens fucking <b>constantly</b> and i hate it.
<br>
<br>
i actually had fun with the whole lamp thing and tried to integrate it into the roleplay a little bit. there was a bit of area made with f3x over near the 10,000 steps challenge from BF{B}DI[DFB](A) (the new hip acronym for mentioning BFDI in any of it's four seasons) so i teleported master there and lamped him. as nitori this would be a RATHER INTERESTING TYPE OF <b>LAMP</b> if i had to be honest on that. she mentioned "like WOW it's one of those WEIRD LAMPS. i've never sene a lamp like this, is it suppose to be one of those national monuments or something Hah Hah". i'm probably not very good at roleplaying as nitori just yet but i'm Learning so at least give me some time. i mean, we all had to start somewhere, didn't we? <i>didn't we?</i> anyways yeah that was one of the sideplots, but the main thing that kept the nitori train going was the NEW PLOT !!!  so on the server there were some trusted users and moderators who were part of the furry community (which we all know that <code>master</code> just DESPISES), and one of the characters was a short white fluffy one that i forgot the name of, and they told me (nitori) that snowi had died. now, snowi was one of wolfgirl's (the changed (something that i don't want to explain (please don't ask me what it is (it's horrible (ah))))) characters with orange blood. for the sake of storytelling i'll just call the short white one jerry or something i have no fucking clue lol.
<br>
<br>
anyways jerry and nitori went over to near the forest's campfire and snowi was found dead in MIAMI......... yikes my dude i can't believe snowi bleeds orange juice. that joke was from nitori said. "bro i never knew those type of creatures bleed orange juice". this upset jerry beyond comprehension. after this sad revelation of eventful turns, pementa (roleplaying as <b>colossal (which i think is supposed to be the object version of a tv logo or something (could be wrong))</b>) joins in and offers to check snowi's pulse to make sure she's not just unconscious or she's hanging onto life by a mere fucking THREAD. after some intense checking of the pulse by standing next to snowi, colossal states that she is indeed, <b>dead</b> in miami. this upset everyone besides nitori, since she was just dragged into the situation with little to no context on what the fuck's even going on to begin with. the first thing that came to her mind when it came to a dead body was to dump it into the ocean (or to bury it), which everyone literally tried to stop nitori from doing, but she already had the body picked up and put on her head (i mean she's a square how else are we gonna portray her carrying something without putting it on top of her), making her somewhat slower but she got a bit close to the ocean before someone had the idea of using the hand powered recovery center in the main part of the mainland so she could be recovered. needless to say, that actually worked. problem solved! nitori then talked about cucumbers and stood still for 20 minutes before <i>i</i> got bored and left the server, ending the roleplay for myself.
<h2>12:03 pm</h2>
i'd love to continue from here but this actually ends this blog post about nitori and i wanted to shift to a different topic since this is a 3 parter. in this case, that ends today's blog post and i'll be going to the next post when i come back during the afternoon when i have social studies last subject today. it's friday, what else am i supposed to say>
<br>
<br>
anyways bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?
