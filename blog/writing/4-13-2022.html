<p>"Hey, could you pour me another one?"<br />"Oh, it'd be my /honor/, your majesty~"<br />"Hahaha shut up, man"<br />

    <br />Where are you, on some kind of beach? The hell are you doing here? You're meant to be in your
    depression hole-- it's what we have on the itinerary for the day. Right here, see? We're supposed to be knee-deep
    into your four hour crybaby power hour by now.</p>

<p><br />You would make a new calendar with the correct date, but things haven't changed since your birthday, at least
    not by a whole lot, so you think it's a truer reflection of yourself to leave the calendar as untouched as your
    daily routine is. Is that what it's like to become an adult? The days blend into one amalgagum /super/ day that
    actually lasts a whole year? I mean, you're only 20 years old dude, you can't let yourself get to this point of
    deprecation already; you can't even legally drink yet and you're already having mental breakdowns the likes of
    upper-middle class dads.<br /><br />"So what's on your head? We've never been this place before. ...is this even
    California anymore?"<br />"I don't know, man. We're just away. Shit got old and it got old fast. I actually came
    here /because/ I had too much shit on my head. Expelling all the toxins, you feel?"<br />"...but you only ever talk
    to me /when/ you have shit on your head. Isn't this conversation entirely antithetical to you /not/ wanting shit on
    your head right now?"<br />"Well..."<br /><br />You put your glass of wine back down onto the fold-out table between
    the two of you. Hahahaha, is that Pepsi? Straight out of the can? No ice? Hahahaha dude it's like eighty degrees
    out. Did you even bring sunscreen? Okay, you put your wine glass full of warm Pepsi back down onto the fold-out
    table between the two of you. You take a deep breath and look out into the warm Not California beach. You're both on
    the comfiest camping chairs you could find at the local Bass Pro Shop, the type that that your body always just
    naturally fits into. Both your chairs are dug into the sand real good, and under the fold-out table you share is a
    box marked for twenty four cans of Pepsi, now containing only a measly twenty /two/ cans. Ever since Covid threw
    down the gauntlet, this beach's been entirely depraved of people, which is good! The two of you deserve your
    uninterrupted privacy. Behind and all around the beach are the usual assortments of palm trees and bushes. Out in
    front of the two of you is the Pacific Ocean itself. You're not in California anymore, but there's no way you're
    looking at anything /but/ the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />"I mean, I /do/ have a lot going on right now. I want you
    here because, like... I don't know, you never get to relax. I'm always talking you down with all the things going on
    in my head, and it feels wrong to just... You know?"<br />"To never let me have a day off?"<br />"Yeah! Yeah,
    exactly. So I thought it'd be a good idea to, you know, take a trip out here, take it easy for once."<br />"I
    mean..."<br /><br />The person next to you looks out into the ocean and takes a thoughtful sip out of their own
    wineglass.<br /><br />"I don't /need/ a break, you know. I mean, not from listening to what you have to say, at
    least."<br /><br />They look like they're putting their thoughts together, but all of this is stuff you've already
    heard from them before.<br /><br />"I really care about everything you have to say. And I really care about /you/,
    too, so that's why I listen. I want to be the one you can trust with all the things you can't say to
    others."<br />"It's all you do, though. You just listen. For as long as I've known you, you've been the audience
    member to our own relationship. Don't you get tired of it? I mean, the shit I drop on you, dude, it sucks."<br />"I
    mean... /Yeah/, it sucks. Nobody goes on wild sunlight-deprived rants because their life is going /good/. But it's
    my job to listen, right? So I don't mind. This vacation's more for your own sake than it is for mine."<br />"I
    guess."<br /><br />You both chill and let the ocean waves do the talking for now. Hey, while you two do that, I just
    checked, and it's not even 2021 anymore, bozo. You should REALLY update that calendar; we're past your 21st
    birthday! You CAN legally drink! And you SHOULD be drinking! Dude, you two would be having SO much more fun if you had some of that hard shit. Twenty four cans of Dr. Pepper bootlegs instead of that Pepsi Cola swill
    you have on you right now.</p>

    <img src="/img/blog/writing/bucket list.gif" alt="A stack of 38 cans, 5 1-liter bottles, and 2 smaller bottles, each a different Dr. Pepper bootleg brand. Dr. Bob, Dr. Thunder, and Dr. Faygo are notable." title="A stack of 38 cans, 5 1-liter bottles, and 2 smaller bottles, each a different Dr. Pepper bootleg brand. Dr. Bob, Dr. Thunder, and Dr. Faygo are notable." class="center" width="289"> 

<p>You could down a can of Dr. THUNDER while crying out your feelings, then your friend could hand you a Dr. FAYGO and
    have shit get turned up to an 11 REAL quick just like that. Just think about it for next time, okay? You crack open
    your third can of Pepsi and exhale.<br /></p>
<p><br />"Recently, I took a nap."<br />"That's the third one this year!"<br /><br />It's April.<br /><br />"I got
    really stressed, I didn't want to think anymore. There's never a point in my day I'm /not/ thinking about everything
    in my life ever."<br />"Tell me about it."<br />"I am!"<br />"No, like, 'Ohh, TELL me about it, dude.'"<br />"Oh. I
    will!"<br /><br />You lean over and pour them a refill from your can. You sink back into your chair and take another
    breath.<br /><br />"I mean, you know me, right. I'm always thinking. I'm always thinking about all the things I
    /could/ be doing that I'm /not/. I'm thinking of all the opportunities I'm not taking right now, and that everyone
    who /is/ taking those opportunities is better than me for it. And they are!"<br />"Yeah, you're just, like, a basic
    human, right?"<br />"Yeah; and they're all, like, crazy future humans. Like, the latest model of humans. I'm like
    the MS DOS of humans. Like, you know how it had that cute 'hello' in cursive when it came out?"<br /><br />That was
    Apple's Macintosh.</p>

    <img src="/img/blog/writing/macintosh.gif" alt="An early Apple Macintosh computer with the word 'Hello' on its display in cursive typeface." title="An early Apple Macintosh computer with the word 'Hello' on its display in cursive typeface."class="center" width="289"> 

<p>"And how it made it appear human? Steve Jobs even made it give a text-to-speech speech when he unveiled it. It was,
    like, it's a computer. But it was so endearing that it felt /human/. Like, it looked interesting and nuts at the
    time, too, but now the latest computers have, like, Minecraft and shit. They have way more depth to them. And I'm
    here, like... Like, everyone else is /AI/ computers. Like, they learn shit and expand themselves and become better
    and faster and stronger. And, like, I'm a regular computer; I'm only made up of what others put into me. They're AI
    and learn and I'm not."<br />"This analogy doesn't make sense."<br />"I'm saying, like... Ugh! UGH! What /am/ I
    saying?!"<br /><br />You pour yourself-- Oh, my bad; you drink directly out of the can this time.<br /><br />"I'm
    like-- I'm nobody, right? You put shit into me and I /become/ somebody, but I don't put shit into myself. I'm like a
    glowstick. I just sit there until somebody /else/ picks up and cracks me, and then I'm alive for a bit, and I feel
    great and satisfied with how my life's going, and then, you know, the glow fades out and I'm dead again. I mean,
    like, what I mean is--"<br /><br />You desperately sigh and straighten out your back. You turn to face your friend
    and try again WITHOUT the stupid analogies.<br /><br />"I don't think I'm my own person. I think everything I say
    and do is derivative of what the people /around/ me think and say. There isn't an ounce of me /in/ me; it's all
    stuff I see in other people, think is cool, and then take for myself. And that's what I think about a lot; I'm just
    not my own person, and that means I don't have my own thoughts, and that means I'll never be the me I want to be, so
    I'll never write a creative work wholly my own or meet somebody who I can see the full breadth of and have them see
    the full breadth of /me/ in return. I don't think I'll ever realize what others see in me, and I think that's
    because everything everybody sees in me just comes from somebody cooler that I ripped it from."<br /><br />You lean
    back into your chair.<br /><br />"So when I took that first nap earlier this year, It was, um... It was nice. For
    the first time in maybe ever I chose to /not/ think about anything. When I sleep, it's because I have to or I won't
    be able to function the next day. But that nap? I /chose/ to stop thinking, and to slow down and relax myself in
    every way possible. I woke up and I felt happy. It was relaxing and new. I recognized that not thinking about things
    /isn't/ a waste of time. That's why the next day I did it again when I got home. I realized I'm tired, and that I
    had good reason to be! This type of stressful 'I'm nobody' thinking sucks! So I took a break from it! And today, I
    napped again! And it was my third nap of the year! And I woke up, and I realized YOU need a break, too. And you need
    to stop worrying about everything, and be happy in the solace that all of your troubles, which is to say /my/
    troubles, are being put aside for the first time in years."<br />"That's... thoughtful. I think?"<br />"I mean, if
    I'm getting a day off, you are, too. I need to treat us better; we're on the precipice of self-destruction every
    day, and it turns out that not panicking is just good for the mind."<br />"That makes sense."<br />"So why don't we
    spend the rest of the day like this? No more stressing out. Just you, me, and, you know, a severe lack of thoughts."
