Approximately seven or eight or more minutes ago as I write this at 10:06, I've swallowed two liquicaps of ZzzQuil. I chewed one a bit. At the moment Sleepy Shut-In's JRPG Musical Nostalgia is playing (The one that opens with Paper Mario music (His third mix (they're all off YT he's ruploading them tho))). In front of me is a note that reads

I saw a police line-up in my sleep.

It's 10:08 and now I'm listening to 3 More Hours of Relaxing Super Nintendo Music by SNESdrunk. I'm downloading Metal Gear Solid for the Playstation.

I'm going to shoot the fuck out of this before I get wrangled by sleep pills.









I don't think you understand the severity of the situation.
Okay, buddy, listen, I've been around the block before; I can handle myself.
Okay, so have the seven guys in there, and the last batch of eight before them, and the batch before them. You're not gonna back out; I've never given this talk to anybody who's backed out.
He throws open the steel door.
But I'm still obligated to tell you you're gonna die.
Listen buddy, I /know/ my shit. And even if I didn't, I don't CARE if I'm dying!
I brush past him and give him a glitzy grin, finger guns and wink. Door shuts, lights off.
"Okay, are you ready for the line-up?"
Cover your mouth, do that that 'tch' static sound you do when roleplaying being on a radio, read that line. One-way glass, megaphone this side, microphone the other.
"Yeah..."
New voice, this guy sounds timid; doesn't know what's going on.
FWOOSH!
Lights go on, straight in my face. Takes a moment to adjust, but I can't keep my eyes open all the way by the end.
"Do you recognize any of these people."
"Ah..."
Sounds real nervous.
"...that guy..."
Lights focus on someone else here.
"THAT'S JIM-- JIM, THAT IS YOU, I RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE, THAT'S JIM FROM THE VIDEO STORE."
Okay, he's the guy being set up then. He stomps up to the glass divider and looks real deep into it, scanning left and right.
"The witness now rescinds his accusation."
Lights are back, you can hear voices on the other side of the glass. Jim's scared.
"The witness now reaffirms his accusation."
Lights back on the guy by the glass. The sounds of drilling. We see a perfect circle quickly draw itself onto the glass. It's complete, and a foot kicks it down. The leg sticks itself back into the other room, and out comes an arm. It shoots a dart gun at the perp. He runs at the hole in the glass but falls asleep halfway through it. He gets dragged in, Miranda Rights uselessly draped onto him.
"Okay fellas, good work!"
A bobby pops his head through the glass.
"But you!"
He's got a big moustache, real stereotypical guy, finish the picture.
He grabs the broken-off slice of glass with a suction cup. With his other hands, he points at me. He pulls himself back into the other room and pulls in the slab of glass to its home. It melds back with the rest of the one-way.
Lights on me, all of them.
"We need you gone, you know that."
I know I need myself gone but the cops too?
"You're a real top-branch type'a scum, li'l guy."
Okay, now listen, I knwo that, but how do YOU know that?!
"There's something you're missing, buddy; we've never seen anybody taint this room with so much indifference before."
It literally does NOT matter how much I care.
I hear some papers rustling over the megaphone. That's charges. That's them getting their charges put together. Party likes to do that to its indesirables.
"You know that guy's due for flogging right?"
Yeah of course that's one of three whole possible customary punishments in our little corner of the world.
"Why didn't you care."
Lights are getting insufferable.
I DON'T.
"Why."
I don't NEED to.
"But why."
You can't-- I-- WHY SHOULD I? I won't EVER care for what you WANT me to care about.
"WHY, NOT."
They're taking notes.
I don't WANT to care; you serve me this shit on a silver platter day in and day out as if you're the ones in charge--
Lights go purple.
--which you ARE--
White.
--of what I THINK. You control my body, my movement, my day-in day-out schedule and my entire life already. Every time something happens you want me to throw myself down, tear at the walls and BARK like a dog that wants to go outside real bad. You want me ALL. I don't /get/ it. You have that guy you arrested, you have the last batch, you have all your little bobbies-- Even the queen isn't her own. Yet HERE WE ARE!
I step out and outstretch my arms.
ALL BECAUSE you want my mind, too-- you want me not GONE, you want me YOURS. You want me to give a shit about the crap you have to say. You want to matter-- you DON'T. I'm here for a $20 line-up participation compensation. Then I'll be out of here. You'll have been nothing in my life, and that's scary isn't it? The system failed, I slipped through, and you still can't catch us all. That's never gonna change.
I can hear new sounds back there-- isn't flogging meant to be public?
You WANT me to care, and that's the issue.
I walk to the glass, get as close as I can.
And MY issue? I DO care. I DO care no matter how hard I pretend.
I go through the glass. There's the bobby I'm talking with, Dart Bobby, and Flog Guy. I walk up to the first-- Why's he got this superior expression?
"ZzzQuil's setting in. Write something thoughtful next time."
