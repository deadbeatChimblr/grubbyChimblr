<h1>The May 5th Inaugural Post</h1>
<h2>May 1 2022 1:00 PST</h2>
<p>Welcome to the inaugural post! It's not really an inaugural post if the thing being inaugurated is still under construction, though, is it? In reality, I'm just making this post so I have something on this site that's actually mine (thank you rust) to help set the scene, right? I have lots of things I want to say and do, and it's good to get the first foot in the door so as to keep myself marching along!</p>

<img src="/img/blog/2022/5/constructiongender.jpg" alt="another day another GENDER (all three of these images were stock photos of construction workers)" style="width:265px">

<p>I also don't know who the audience of this blog is going to be when it actually gets settled into itself. At the moment, I know that rust (thank you ruuust) and another friend know about it, but they're the ones listed as contributors to the <i>original</i> version of this site, the one I'm demolishing, so it makes sense. I THINK that the only way for people to find this place from here on out is going to be through caring about me enough to search up my username (editor chris's note: at the time this was written (8 days ago) the site's URL was my usual username instead of deadbeatChimblr) on common internet archive search engine DuckDuckGo OR through sheer luck. Both types of people are very welcome! If I ever just like drop the link on my disc bio then I'll update this page. We'll see how this goes!</p>

<h3>May 4 19:58 PST</h2>
<p>Hey so it's May 4th right now and I think 1am chris was a bit too sleepy to uhh, yknow, recognize that it's not the fifth day of the month; it's just the fifth month. In reality this post STARTED on May 1st and has been rewritten on May 4th; it's not even the titular day of the post as of writing this.</p>

<p>I think this is the plan for the blog for now:</p>
    <p>
    1. Transfer over my creative writing to this blog.<br>
    2. Keep up the Spring Cleaning.
</p>

<p>After that, I think I'll start actually writing all-new stuff in here.</p>
