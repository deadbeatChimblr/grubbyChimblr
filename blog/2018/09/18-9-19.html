<p>timestamps aren't here for this one</p>

<p>the del- <em>cough</em> 'scuse me.</p>

<p>The delay was inevitable. With all of these ongoing projects, there's no way I can possibly keep things afloat without some sort of indefinite delay between posts. What can I say? At least the shared experiences were something I've always wanted to do.
