There's some things you don't think about,<br>
which you ought to,<br>
but when you think about them,<br>
you really don't know what to think.<br>
Also, you're me.<br>
I'm talking to myself.<br>
You've realized you can't do it on your own,<br>
and it's best to put it off until it changes.<br>
Admittedly,<br>
ignoring the problem has done you the most benefit.<br>
You did this a year, two years ago, remember.<br>
You hated the sum of your parts,<br>
and for no real reason.<br>
And you couldn't think about it right,<br>
so you repeated your lies,<br>
which are your truths now.<br>
And it worked.<br>
So when we say we<br>
ought<br>
to think abaout this.<br>
Truthfully, that's a lie;<br>
when we think about this,<br>
all of it,<br>
we only lie to ourselves.<br>
We feel excludes,<br>
and dull;<br>
not the sum of our parts anymore;<br>
our selves are dull by necessity of being us.<br>
When we're surrounded by the magnamous brightness of our friend,<br>
it seems that nothing we've done ourselves<br>
has been anything but the biggest cheat to our expansion,<br>
the biggest cheat any one person could have conducted against any single being, will, or concept,<br>
and she returns,<br>
and we learned creation;<br>
we've introduced her to life so that we may kill her.<br>
, friend,<br>
poison won't seep your veins anymore,<br>
anger, frustration,<br>
listless vengeful nature,<br>
kill it.<br>
dismiss it all;<br>
do better.
