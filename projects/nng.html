<p>Nichijou No Gaiden (abbreviated as NNG) was a web-comic/animation series that I made a while ago. It was one of my first <i>big</i> projects, although now that title belongs to <a href="klaust_.html">klaust_</a>. NNG was going to be a mix of the characters from Nichijou with the style of Battle for BFDI, a series by Jacknjellify.</p>
<p>NNG was canceled for several reasons, although most were my fault due to a lack of proper structure, poor planning, mistreatment, and having too much planned at once. It was going to be an animation, then a web-comic, then both, a visual novel was considered, there's a subreddit and Wikia page that have been untouched, and two brand accounts made, being Team Gaiden and Taugamma. Both groups are gone now, for your information.</p>
<p>All that currently remains now are the promotional material, scripts, and assets. Some web-comic pages were done, but nothing had come out of them.</p>

<p>I <i>have</i> tried to bring this project back a few times, however I've been unable to allocate any time for it, and I feel that it's still too much of a mess for me to come back to. Assets and scripts are available at the <a href="/misc/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.</p>
