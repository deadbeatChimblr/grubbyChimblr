<h1>the two-hour BRAIN DEATH</h1>
<h2>March 6 2022 22:40~ - 00:05 PST</h2>

<p>Since I was young I've been pushed on by my parents to be a fiscally successful person; I've been pushed to study hard and work hard so I could make enough money to buy our family a house. Entering high school, that framework of thought most probably helped burn me out. But at the same time, there was an additional factor running in that all of my friends were the "bro" type, and all the entertainment I experienced, I consumed and forgot about rather than appreciated and thought about; it was all stuff meant to merely pass the time. That second part isn't so much my fault since I was, like, 14 years old. But still. In high school, I got a smartphone, and the discovery of Discord coincided with a tremendous fall in my grades and an insane lack of desire to put in effort into my life which I'm still rebuilding slowly, but surely. I actually don't remember any of high school; it's all a blurry single piece of time that I rely on my friends to remind me about the specifics of. Maybe that's the way I deal with it. That's DEFINITELY the way I deal with it!</p>

<p>Returning to when I mentioned the smartphone and Discord; The way I actually joined Discord was through Reddit; I used to actively browse and participate in r/StevenUniverse; Steven Universe itself is, I think, my favorite animated series ever of all time. Still haven't finished it, though. The subreddit has a sister community lounge sub called r/BeachCity, for SU fans, but not on-topic for SU. I remember getting really active in both subreddits, and eventually noticing there was a link to a Discord server on the sidebar. So I got curious about what that was, clicked, and unknowingly tipped one of the most seminal domino pieces in the terribly convoluted and weird bungee-cord-length trail that tumbles down the path to who I am today.</p>

<p>This changed the paradigm of thought I have /extremely/. It was the first time I was continuously exposed to the same completely estranged-to-myself people repeatedly; we knew nothing about each other's lives, and we shared only a mutual interest in a single show as the starting point in our relationships, but we also had a genuine interest in each other's stories! The conversations weren't just "what do we do on Roblox when we get back home" or "this CRAZY thing happened in Battlefield the other day." I met people who I was curious about who were so different to me! Zoe and Dr. Chandra, Jaden, WaveringLibido. They were all wildly different and interesting people, and unfortunately, they all had to put up with the biggest loser of a Chris back when we talked. I had more authentic friends in them than I ever had before, and over time, we came apart. As of last I checked, the Steven Universe Discord is set to read-only, to act as an archive of the community that once was there as activity had died and people had moved to wherever they went. It's how it goes, right? The archival actually predates the addition of threads to Discord, so those actually have new messages.</p>

<p>I rejoined an off-shoot server and hung out there for a bit a year or two (assumptions of length of time (I don't really know when the server got archived)) before that happened, but it was more than a bit weird, so I left before joining my next community. I guess I shouldn't mention this one by name if I don't want all .5 monthly readers to find me? But there I've met the most important people in my life; people who've taught me about what being a person is, what being trans is, what having a meaningful connection with somebody else is, and so so /so/ much more within those concepts and beyond. In this community, I've (re?)learned how to appreciate different things; how to think more of what's around me and absorb it. Again with what I mentioned about learning to creatively write in <a href="/blog/2022/5/5-5-2022.html">the 5/5 post</a>; it feels like I'm relearning stuff that should be basic knowledge. It feels very very embarassing occasionally, but I don't really have an alternative, so~. And in this community, from the conversations I've had with the great people there, I've been able to more deeply appreciate the stuff I look at and engage with: I'm rewatching Steven Universe with the person mentioned in the footnotes of <a href="/blog/writing/3-29-2022.html">9:05PM-9:37PM</a> at the moment, and it's funny how many subjects just didn't land with baby me. I was young, so ofc they wouldn't, but it's still funny. Things like fusion didn't make sense to me when I was young, and now talking about it with my best friend, they said they appreciated fusion for its lack of a one-to-one representation in our world. And it's true! There's different aspects to fusion, and some of those aspects involve human concepts, but overall, it's not a concept I fully understand, but as opposed to when I was young, I know I'm okay with not understanding; my appreciation for it is only positively impacted by not having a full understanding of it; it's not entirely human, and that's really good and positive.</p>

<p>Additionally, I recently replayed (and subsequently rewatched twice) the Beginner's Guide, written by Davey Wreden, and the same happened there; lots of baggage I didn't have the ability to see in the past when I watched Sips play it when I was 14, now in front of and visible /to/ me. It's interesting, with the creative works I look at now, and especially with the creative writing my best buddy sends me, coinciding with me picking up creative writing for myself, too, whilst also being surrounded by the most talented people I've ever met, localized in the community I'm in now-- all of this combines into an emotional amalgam that made the Beginner's Guide really relatable, for how nuanced and abstract of a concept it presents.</p>

<p>I have lots of weird emotions now after opening my THIRD EYE, and a lot of the time I think it'd be better to be the dumb bozo I used to be again, but I also see a lot more beauty around me; the writing my best friend shares with me, the physical world around me, and what made me start all of this; the beautiful music inspired and passionate people make to score beautiful stories. At the risk of sounding like the guy in the "if chopin made good music: *nightcore undertale ost*" joke, what started this self reflection was listening to Amalgam from the Steven Universe soundtrack, then Time Piece Released and Scootin' through Clocktowers Beneath the Sea from the A Hat in Time soundtrack. At the start of this, I realized I was engaging in something for more than to merely progress my career or to pass the time until I continued progressing my career again; I was engaging in something to wholly appreciate it for what it is and what it means to me. And then began a whole reflection on who I was in the relatively recent past and who I am now. While writing this, I also noticed I now deeply appreciated something that, when I was younger, I passed off on. I played a Hat in Time I think around a year ago as of now, and I really appreciate the emotions, nostalgia, and love it gave and still gives me. I had actually skipped on it years before without giving it a chance, and now I get to appreciate another thing past Chris missed out on. I don't know how much I'll edit this before I publish it-- these words are being typed out on my phone while I'm in bed listening to the second aforementioned track-- but I do want to say to my friends who are most surely not reading this because they don't know this blogs exists; I love you, and the positive force you all are on me is something I'll never be able to repay to you all. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing your friendship with me, thank you for the care and love you show me, and I love you all. I hope I've been and can keep being a good friend to you; you deserve everything good, ever.</p>

<p>Hey, this editor Chris at 8:15PM the next day. It turns out I didn't actually remove a lot from this post while editing it! Maybe I'm a PSYCHO BLOGGER, because that was all typed out while I was losing consciousness at 12PM and I still understand it. The less likely option, though, is that it's all actually coherent and normal sounding. Who knows! Point is, I wanted to leave an after-note because, while reading this, I remembered that either yesterday or the day before, I had actually driven out to get doughnuts, and on the drive, I was listening to an episode of the Triforce Podcast. It's one of the recent ones-- no later than episode #218-- and in it, Lewis and Pflax mentioned how, growing up, parents often hammer into their children that any moment not spent studying is wasted. Pflax is, like, 40 or whatever, he's got two or three kids, is married, and was calling that type of thought ludicrous, with Lewis and maybe? Sips agreeing. But I remember feeling really happy and reassured when hearing that; here were these reasonable, 40-year-old but still super chill adults saying "That type of thought is so wrong, especially when people in their early 20s are being convinced that their time is running out." My theory is that /that/ part of the episode stayed in my subconscious, which allowed this massive two-hour rant to go through in the first place. Anyways, I'm wrapping up the post now at 8:25PM. Thanks for reading, lots of love, Chris.</p>
