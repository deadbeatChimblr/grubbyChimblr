<p>RWBY House was a Khonjin House parody that I mainly wrote after IceCreamJaxxie sent me an audio recording of her attempt of a cartoony voice, that of which I wanted to animate. At the time, Khonjin had just releaed the "MAKE YOUR OWN KHONJIN" .fla file, which included all the original Khonjin assets, although I was also working on my own at the time that traced over the assets (such as Geno, who turned out to be a bitmap in the actual .fla).</p>
<p>A few episodes of RWBY House were written, with 3 episodes total. A fourth and a intro were done, but only the intro remains and episode 4 was never animated. Spencer actually voices some of the characters. We used to be friends, then rivals, now we kinda just look at each other funny. With that in mind, I don't think continuing RWBY House is a worthwhile idea, and I'm not even that interested in RWBY. Neo's not supposed to speak, but low and behold, here she is voiced by <i>Spencer</i> of all people.</p>
<p>I'd get into more on RWBY House's eventual cancellation, but the details are pretty iffy, and it's best to move on.</p>
<p>(i reference the project nowadays, like in cfan4)</p>
