<p>CFAN4 is the predecessor to MWT, with a different cast yet the same premise. Jay and Elle, the main characters, are told to do challenges by the duo being Blursed Table and Blursed Chair. While similar to MWT, both series take place in different areas (although the same universe is used).</p>
<p>Currently, CFAN4/MWT are planned for a merge, as handling two different plots is getting hard to catch up with, and I'd rather have one problem instead of two.</p>
<p class="boxed"><b>UPDATE // 7/31/2021</b><br>I'm currently partaking in CFAN6, so that aforementioned "merge" won't happen for a while, if at all. Turns out I never got started with it.

	<td><p>Another one of the two members of the duo, Elle works with Jay with the same ideas, although isn't as merciless. She smiles greater, and is generally more playful (although that doesn't mean Jay can't do the same). The both finish each other's sentences and sometimes say the exact same thing without prior planning.</p></td></tr>
